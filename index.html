    <p>My name is Emily Rockarts. I’m a professional musician based in Montreal, Quebec.
    I released my debut album this past April with big plans to tour, showcase, and promote
    my new record after being awarded funding by the Canada Council for the Arts and the
    Foundation Assisting Canadian Talent on Recordings (FACTOR) to record and market the album,
    and hiring a full marketing team. Due to COVID-19 all of that is on hold right now, and for
    the foreseeable future to keep everyone safe. </p>

    <p>Looking ahead to a year without any performances or festival bookings, I began to think about
    how I could make a positive change in my life and learn some new skills to be useful and helpful
    in other ways until the music industry returns. </p>

    <p>The world of code and web development has always interested me as an outside observer and is an
      invaluable skillset in our current age of technology. Coding has endless possibilities and applications
    in our world, from app creation, web development and data science across all industries. </p>

    <p>This past June, I was accepted to the Switchup and Coursereport #1 rated coding school <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/montreal">Le Wagon</a>, for their
     9 week web development Bootcamp here in Montreal. Since starting  Le Wagon in July, the course has been a
     comprehensive and intensive study across the full stack of web development skills, including: </p>

    <p>Le Wagon focuses on product-based challenges and I will complete the program having built two web apps
      with teammates using our own code from scratch. Check out our first project! <a href="https://sports-marketplace.herokuapp.com/">Sportify</a> </p>

    <p>Coming from a background with zero experience in coding, this program has been challenging, intense, and
      frustrating but also, extremely rewarding. I am amazed with how much I have learned in such a short time
      and I can't wait to develop my skills further in this new career. It's incredible how much a web design can make
      a difference on a page. This application for example, went from what you see below to what you see now with all the skills I've learned so far. </p>

    <p>I am so excited to be taking part in Le Wagon’s bootcamp. The world of code offers endless possibilities
      for employment in so many diverse industries. I am excited about the flexibility having these skills will bring
      to me by either working for a company that I am passionate about, or freelancing. Coding not only seems like a
      positive career change for the next year but once the music industry returns I think it would act as a complimentary
      skillset to my music career to work as a freelancer on web projects and contracts during the off seasons of
      being a musician. </p>

    <p>Having worked as a freelance musician for the past five years I have adapted to working with a tight budget
      as an emerging artist to live in my industry. However, having a large portion of my income disappear due to
      COVID-19 has been stressful.  Receiving this scholarship would help immensely with the financial burden of
      tuition fees in my new career of coding. If selected, the entirety of my scholarship would go towards paying
      a portion of my tuition and help me to reduce debt while looking for a new position or contract in the world
      of web development. </p>
